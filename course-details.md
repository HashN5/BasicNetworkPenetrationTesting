## Basic Network Penetration Testing ##
Welcome to the Beginner Network Pentesting course. This course gives an opportunity for students and professionals who are interested in becoming an ethical hacker / penetration tester the chance to learn and practice skills necessary to excel in the field. Throughout the course, we will cover basics of network penetratin testing. We will try to do as much as possible hands on lessons but sometimes you need to also learn about boring stuff too :)

The course will not be on fully blown one video. You can find the individial videos on my Youtube channel here:

The following lesson plan will give you a brief idea on what we will be covering in this course for next 12 weeks.

## Lesson Plan

- Setting Up A Penetration Testing Environment 

- Introductory Linux - This lesson will briefly cover the important Linux terminal commands needed to use Kali Linux. 

- Introductory Python - Similar to Linux, we will spend some time learning basic Python scripting, which will be essential to penetration testers.

- Hacking in Five Steps - This lesson will introduce the five key components of hacking: reconnaissance, enumeration, exploitation, maintaining access, and covering tracks. 

- The Art of Reconnaissance - This lesson will discuss reconnaissance in depth and cover common tools used in the process. 

- Scanning Tactics - This lesson will cover common tools in-depth that are used for port scanning including Nmap, Nessus, and Metasploit. 
- Enumeration  - The intent of this lesson is to provide an overview of basic enumeration tactics and then dive deep into specific tools used for common ports found in penetration testing. 

- Gaining a Shell with Metasploit - This lesson will cover how to use Metasploit to gain shell access to a vulnerable machine. 

- Compiling Exploits - This lesson will add to exploitation except that the exploitation is now done manually, without Metasploit. 

- When Nothing Else Works - This may include using social engineering and techniques used to gather information or gain access

- Post exploitation Enumeration - This lesson will cover post-exploitation enumeration. 

- Active Directory Exploitation - This lesson focuses on the recognition of vulnerabilities and exploitation tactics in an internal Active Directory environment. 
- Exploiting Non-Active Directory Environments - This lesson will discuss the exploitation of devices in a non-Active Directory environment. 
- Maintaining Access / Pivoting / Cleanup - This lesson will discuss methods of maintaining access on a network, pivoting into other networks, and how to properly clean up as you exit a network.

- The Legal Side of the House - This lesson will cover the important legal aspects that a pentester must know prior to conducting a penetration test. 
- Report Writing - This lesson will cover the importance of report writing in penetration testing and walk through what should be included in a penetration test report.
